I am a web developer and I have been actively studying web technologies for almost two years. I also have experience in commercial development. Thus I have acquired really important skills and knowledge.

I have profound knowledge in JavaScript. I have also learned Java on a decent level.

I have practiced working with Redis and SQL databases, and I know how to work with them effectively.

For more than a year I have been working with React components using various libraries, such as Mantine and Ant Design. Iâ€™ve been also dealing with mobile applications on React Native using Mobx.

I am skilled at making semantic, cross-browser and adaptive web pages using HTML, CSS and SASS/SCSS preprocessors. I am also familiar with the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology, that helps me write structured and readable code.

I am striving to improve myself and expand my knowledge all the time. Recently, I have successfully completed a one-year web-development course from the HTML Academy, designed to train JavaScript. This helped me deepen my knowledge in JS and become a more confident developer.

Now I am looking for new opportunities for professional growth and development. I am ready to join your team and contribute to the projects you are developing. I will be glad to cooperate with you!
